UI integration 14:
- Change mouse cursor to "Hand cursor" when hovering clickable elements on all pages
- RegisterDevice page:
	- Add device watcher to watch for device removal events, on removal > Navigate to WaitingForDevice page if numOfRegsiteredDevices = 0, if not navigate to MainPage
	- Expand clickable zone for Regsiter and Cancel to bottom of grid
- WaitingForDevice page : add 1s delay on device detection before navigating to RegsiterDevice page

TODO : 
- Find a way to add "divider" Image without bugging the UI
- Rename apdu.cs and its containing classes
