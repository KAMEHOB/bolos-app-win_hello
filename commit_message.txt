UI pre-integration :
- New page "waitingForDevice" : when no devices are registered yet, app opens on a new page asking the user tu plug a device to register
- When the user inserts a device with win hello app running, switch to Mainpage with nameyourdevice pop-up
- If the user unregisters all the devices, the app swithes to "waitingForDevice" page

TODO:
- split the BGtask with two different tasks one triggered by auth trigger, and onother one triggered by device add/remove/update event
- add a clickable icon on listbox for device unregistration
