UI integration 4:
- WaitingForDevice screen : new button assistance with two callbacks for pointerentered (changes image color) and for pointerexited (restore the original color)
- MainPage :
	- new button assistance (same features as in WaitingForDevice screen)
	- register device replacement with new button layout, and two new callbacks : 
		- pointerentered : changes the color
		- pointerexited : restores the original color
		- click : same as before (launches the new device registration)
	- New callbacks on listView StackPanel :
		- pointerentered : makes the "trash" image visible
		- pointerexited : makes the "thash" image collapsed

TODO : On ListViewItem_pointerExited() when e.OriginalSource is ListViewItemPresenter, i reload the page to make the trash icon collapsed, this causes annoying flickering
