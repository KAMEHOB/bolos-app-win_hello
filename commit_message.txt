Switched calls to writeConnectedRegisteredDevices and PerformAuthentication in BGtask (.add trigger), to speed up the autentication time on plug autnetication
Added 'deferral = taskInstance.GetDeferral();' at every trigger begin, and 'deferral.Complete();' at every trigger end

TODO:
- new strategy for dLock : add bool to device config data to indicate if device was used for last login
- split the BGtask with two different tasks one triggered by auth trigger, and onother one triggered by device add/remove/update event
