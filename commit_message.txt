New feature, when removing a device, we lock the workstation if dLock is activated on that device and if that device was used for last logon.
On registration we initialize that value as if the device was used for last logon (to allow dLock feature to be available before using the device for first logo)

TODO:
- split the BGtask with two different tasks one triggered by auth trigger, and onother one triggered by device add/remove/update event
