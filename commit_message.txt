Bug correction: it is now possible to register a new device when a previously registered device is still plugged (before modif, we had to unplug the first device before registering a new one)
Add device friendly name in deviceConfigurationData, and in the connectedRegisteredDevices file

TODO:
- split the BGtask with two different tasks one triggered by auth trigger, and onother one triggered by device add/remove/update event
