UI integration 13:
- New confirmation MessageDialog. When tapping the trash icon, call to "Trash_Tapped" callback, a "YES"/"NO" MessageDialog appears asking for user confirm:
	- Yes > unregister device
	- No > navigate to MainPage

TODO : 
- Find a way to add "divider" Image without bugging the UI
- Rename apdu.cs and its containing classes
