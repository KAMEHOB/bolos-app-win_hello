UI integration 12:
- Created new page "RegisterDevice" that handles device naming and registration, we navigate to this page from :
	- "WaitinForDevice" page on device insertion
	- "MainPage" page on tapping "+ REGISTER" StackPanel
- "RegsiterDevice" page layout from UI spec (logos + disposition + actions...)
- Moved class "listContent" in apdu.cs
- Moved "RegisterDevice_Click" and "FormatDate" in CommomMethods class in apdu.cs

TODO : 
- Find a way to add "divider" Image without bugging the UI
- Rename apdu.cs and its containing classes
