UI pre-integration 2 :
- Use of listview instead of listbox to monitor the registered devices in our app
- Use of listview bindings to get dynamically the info to display (deviceFriendlyName)
- Add in XAML mainpage model a "delete" button (for device unregistration) in every entry in the listview
- RefreshDeviceList() update to align with use of listview (instead of listbox)
- Navigation modification : 
	- in RegisterDevice_Click() once the device is registered we navigate to mainPage, 'using this.Frame.Navigate(typeof(MainPage), "false");' "false" is to indicate that we don't want to register a new device after navigating to mainPage	
	- in UnregisterDevice_Click() once the device is unregistered, we navigate either to mainPage (if number of registered devices != 0), or to waitingForDevice (if number of registered devices = 0)

TODO:
- split the BGtask with two different tasks one triggered by auth trigger, and onother one triggered by device add/remove/update event
- Use bindings to make the delete button visible/hidden
