UI integration 9:
- Removed isVisible member of listContent (not used anymore)
- Align thrash icon with "+ REGISTER" button
- Update "addDate" textBlock margin on ElementStackPanel_PointerEntered() and ElementStackPanel_PointerExited

Bug correction :
- in AuthenticateWithSmartCardAsync() deviceConfigData update with wrong device information was leading to unexpected behaviour for auto lock feature
- starWatcher() called in MainPage() to start the watcher and register the BGtask at app init
- in formatDate()
- in RegisterDevice_Click() count the number of connected devices, and the number of registered connected devices, if they differ => start device registration, if not => inform user that no unregistered device is plugged

TODO : 
- Remove grey background one mouseover
- Find a way to add "divider" Image without bugging the UI
