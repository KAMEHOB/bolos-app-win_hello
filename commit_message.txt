Nanos-Blue app app :
- Created new files to slit nanos and blue code:
	- ux_common.c/h
	- ux_nanos.c/h
	- ux_blue.c/h
- Moved code from main.c to those files
- Implemented ui_idle_mainmenu_blue, ui_settings_blue with confirm login and lock when unplugged options


TODO : 
- Rename apdu.cs and its containing classes
- Add shade around subgrid
- Border outside mainpage is white, find a way to make it grey
