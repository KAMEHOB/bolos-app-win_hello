UI pre-integration # :
- MainPage XAML descriptor update :
	- Add bool to visibility convertor in page ressources
	- Add binding to delete button to make it Visible or Collapsed depending on current device seletion
- Add isVisible (bool) attribute to listContent, this attribute indicates wether we want to show the delete button for that entry
- Add class BooleanToVisibilityConverter, it converts the isVisible (bool) attribute to its Visibility equivalent (true -> Visible / false -> collapsed)
- Swithed type to ObservableCollection for content list (instead of simple list)
- Add 'selectedIndex' parameter to RefreshDeviceList(), to indicate which device is selected, that allows us to make the delete button visible for that device

TODO:
- split the BGtask with two different tasks one triggered by auth trigger, and onother one triggered by device add/remove/update event
